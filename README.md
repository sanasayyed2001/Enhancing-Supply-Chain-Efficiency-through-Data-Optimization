<h1 style="color: #2c3e50;">Enhancing Supply Chain Efficiency through Data Optimization</h1>
<h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on solving various business problems related to supply chain management using advanced SQL queries. The dataset used in this project represents an e-commerce platform's supply chain operations, including transactions, orders, customer details, and shipment data.</p>
<h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this project is to leverage data analytics to optimize e-commerce operations and enhance the customer experience. By addressing key business questions through comprehensive data analysis, we aim to overcome challenges such as fragmented data, real-time decision-making needs, demand forecasting inaccuracies, and logistics inefficiencies.</p>
<h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transaction Analysis:</strong> Identify and analyze the most common types of transactions, ensuring fraudulent cases and specific city exclusions to get an accurate picture.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Identify the top customers based on completed orders to understand customer behavior, geographical trends, and sales contributions.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipping and Department Efficiency:</strong> Analyze shipping modes and departmental preferences to optimize logistics, inventory management, and customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipment Compliance:</strong> Evaluate shipment delays against scheduled shipping days to identify operational inefficiencies and improve delivery processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Order Cancellation Trends:</strong> Calculate the order cancellation percentage by state to pinpoint areas with potential issues like fraud risk, operational inefficiencies, or customer dissatisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset includes information about:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transactions:</strong> Details on various types of transactions (e.g., DEBIT, TRANSFER, PAYMENT, CASH).</li>
    <li><strong>Orders:</strong> Order status, shipment details, and customer information.</li>
    <li><strong>Customers:</strong> Customer IDs, names, cities, and states.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipments:</strong> Shipment modes, scheduled vs. actual shipping days, and order cancellation reasons.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
    <li><code>supply_db.sql</code>: Contains the SQL schema and data used in this analysis.</li>
    <li><code>Supply_chain_base.sql</code>: Includes the SQL queries used to solve specific business problems.</li>
    <li><code>Supply db Data Analysis SANA.pptx</code>: Presentation detailing the project's findings, insights, and business recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Business Problems Addressed</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transaction Analysis:</strong> Identify the most common types of transactions, excluding certain cities and suspected fraud cases.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Insights:</strong> List the top customers based on completed orders, including details like customer ID, name, city, state, number of orders, and total sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipping and Department Analysis:</strong> Analyze order counts by shipping mode and department, focusing on departments with at least 40 completed orders.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipment Compliance:</strong> Create a new field for shipment compliance based on scheduled and actual shipping days, and analyze delays across different shipping modes.</li>
    <li><strong>Order Cancellation Analysis:</strong> Calculate and rank the order cancellation percentage by state, identifying areas with potential issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Popular Transaction Types:</strong> DEBIT transactions are the most common, followed by TRANSFER and PAYMENT.</li>
    <li><strong>Top Customers:</strong> Key customers have been identified, with significant contributions to total sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipping Preferences:</strong> Standard Class is the most preferred shipping method across various departments.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipment Delays:</strong> The project highlights the shipping modes with the highest delays, providing opportunities for operational improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation Trends:</strong> States with higher cancellation rates have been identified, enabling targeted interventions to reduce cancellations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Addressing supply chain challenges through data-driven strategies is crucial for operational excellence and customer satisfaction. This project showcases how SQL can be leveraged to analyze complex datasets, providing actionable insights to optimize e-commerce supply chain operations.</p>
